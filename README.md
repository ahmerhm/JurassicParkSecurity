# JurassicParkSecurity

This project was developed as part of my Internal Assessment for the IB Computer Science course during my senior year of high school. It simulates a "real-life" software development scenario where the developer is tasked with solving a problem for a client. The project follows multiple stages of the software life cycle, as practiced in the real world, including planning, development, client interaction, and evaluation.

## Scenario

The client approached with a problem related to security management, and my role was to develop a Java-based solution to address this issue.

## Stages/Parts

### 1. Planning
- **Problem Description:** The client faced a security management issue that required an automated system for monitoring access points.
- **Rationale for Proposed Solution:** A Java-based application was proposed to track security breaches and monitor the gates to Jurassic Park, ensuring that only authorized personnel could gain entry.
- **Criteria for Success (Requirement Specification):** The solution had to meet the following key requirements:
  - Provide a user-friendly GUI for the client.
  - Ensure secure authentication mechanisms.
  - Log all access attempts with relevant timestamps.
  - Issue alerts when unauthorized access is detected.

### 2. Record of Tasks & Design
- **Task Planning:** A detailed record was maintained of planned and actual dates for each stage of the development process.
- **Design Ideas:**
  - **UML Diagrams** were used to plan out the system’s architecture and component relationships.
  - **GUI Designs** focused on creating an intuitive interface for the client.
  - **Test Plan:** A comprehensive test plan was created to ensure all aspects of the system were thoroughly tested.

### 3. Development
- **Development Techniques:** The project used object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, to create a modular and efficient system.
- **Complex Methods:** Notable methods include access control algorithms, which allowed for dynamic gate monitoring, and alert systems that triggered based on security violations.

### 4. Product
- A video demonstration was created to showcase the product in action, highlighting the core features and user interactions with the system.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Client Evaluation:** After presenting the solution to the client, feedback was collected to evaluate the product’s effectiveness. The solution was deemed successful as it met all the outlined criteria and the client’s needs.

### 6. Appendix (Optional)
- **Source Code:** Full Java source code is included for review.
- **Video Script:** A copy of the script used for the video demonstration is available.
- **Additional Documentation:** Any additional documentation that supports the development and testing process is provided.
